# NHS 111 Data Platform Migration and Cross-Supplier Delivery Leadership

## TL;DR
I led the Data and AI stream for NHS 111 during a major supplier transition, managing a team of eight and providing hands-on engineering and delivery leadership. I migrated 111 telephony analytics from Splunk to Databricks on the NHS UDAL platform, introduced structured data modelling and testing, rebuilt ingestion pipelines, strengthened cross-supplier collaboration, and reinstated core governance practices. The work reduced platform complexity by an order of magnitude, cut operating costs, and improved confidence and stability in a highly regulated environment handling sensitive patient data.

## Case Study

When my organisation became the primary supplier for NHS 111, we had to onboard at pace while existing consultants prepared to roll off. I stepped in as Data and AI lead and took responsibility for the full Data stream, a team of eight, and any analytical or engineering work needed across the wider programme. The environment was challenging: long-standing contractors had built deep relationships and were understandably hesitant about handing over responsibility. My role was to make the transition safe, credible, and collaborative.

### Establishing trust and alignment  
I set up regular catchups with team leads and became the clear point of contact for any issues. Demonstrating competence early was essential, so I ensured we delivered technical walkthroughs, short expert-led sessions, and thoughtful design discussions. This grounded the team and made clear that changes would be gradual, pragmatic, and beneficial.

I reinstated a RAID log for the data function, which had a direct impact on delivery discipline. It helped us surface risks early, avoid deadline slips, and justify changes such as bringing in people with user research experience. These specialists were able to gather clearer requirements, which further improved trust in our work.

### Delivering a safer, simpler, and cheaper data platform  
My hands-on work centred on migrating 111 telephony data collection and analytics from Splunk to Databricks in Azure as part of the NHS UDAL platform. UDAL dictated the technical foundation, but I owned the data architecture, modelling, and testing approach.

Because of the platform's security constraints, I built bespoke ingestion logic rather than relying on UDAL-provided pathways. This involved re-tooling the core ingest code into Python for deployment in an AWS Lambda function, complete with a new test rig. I adopted a medallion architecture backed by Delta tables and implemented development workflows in dbt, including data quality and unit tests. Scheduling was kept simple via Databricks CRON-style jobs with alerting.

The return on this work was significant. By applying proper data modelling and modern tooling, we reduced complexity by an order of magnitude and shrank the amount of bespoke logic required. The platform became easier to maintain with fewer people, stabilising delivery and freeing staff for other NHS 111 priorities. Costs dropped markedly because the Splunk-based workflow was both expensive and an awkward fit for the analytical load.

### Managing sensitive patient data safely  
NHS 111 data contains patient-identifiable information, so high standards of data control and auditability were non-negotiable. We ensured all PII was scrubbed before ingest while keeping reversible encryption for scenarios where a call needed additional care assessment or a GDPR removal request had to be processed. The analytical processes that support the licensed 111 product carry legal weight, so part of my job was ensuring that these procedures were migrated safely, preserved their integrity, and remained defensible.

### Improving cross-supplier collaboration  
Alongside the core migration, another supplier group was preparing for a major future move to a Palantir platform. Multi-vendor NHS environments are often fraught, so I created regular information-sharing sessions and worked hard to establish that we were one team with shared outcomes. My on-the-ground insights helped improve the quality of the migration assessment, while our willingness to contribute openly demonstrated that we were committed to building a healthier long-term delivery culture.
